Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.
        I've included my two most used dot files, .bashrc and .vimrc.  They add a few
        niceties to my terminal, and make coding python in vim a little easier.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
        I don't use a lot of customization of my tools.  I find that when I switch
        machines or environments this helps me out.  Vim is vim is vim is vim no matter
        the system I'm on if it's in a stock config.  My experience is that being 
        effective with the base tool is often more helpful than the extra features
        enabled by a custom config
