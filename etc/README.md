Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

        It was eye opening to look at house prices near where the company is located.  It doesn't
        look like there's much under $500k outside of Longmont.
            $85,000 - 95,000
        
2. When can you start?

        Mid February

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

        A planned trip Mid - Late June

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

        Dogs are wonderful, and a great stress reducer.  I have a yorkie, but don't
        anticipate bringing him to work

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

        For day to day current events NPR
        For tech news:
            Engadget
            Hackaday
            Make
            Wired
            Groups on Google+

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?
    
        Music, enjoying and playing piano, violin, and viola
        Family
        Cooking
        Tinkering (playing with motors, micro-controllers, and electronics in general)

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

        See music above
        Learning French

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

        The main landing page for www.sparkfun.com loads over ~3.5 seconds and transfers ~3MB of data.  It
        would be interesting to investigate methods for reducing bandwidth and server load.  Loading the
        elements on scroll for example might minimize the page size for those visitors that click away
        almost as soon as they land (e.g. search, browse products, click on learn).  Reducing this page
        size would also minimize load on the servers, and potentially reduce the overall band width
        required to run the site.  This also might translate into a reduction of the overhead cost in
        running the site.

        Along the same lines, it would also be interesting to look at integrating more client side
        technologies such as React and Redux.  Being able to hand off page rendering to the client
        would further reduce server load, and could help boost user experience.
